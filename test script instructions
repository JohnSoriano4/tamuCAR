TESTING SCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

ARDUINO SOFTWARE IS NOT REQUIRED, BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. THE LCD DISPLAY SHOULD READ OUT ALL NECESSARY VALUES, BUT THE SERIAL MONITOR WILL GIVE MORE DETAILS
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ARDUINO SOFTWARE FROM https://www.arduino.cc/en/software, select win 10 installer

To use the serial monitor, open the test script in the arduino IDE, and select the appropriate board/com port
Then go to the top menu and choose tools then serial monitor

To use the board, simply power on with the included cable, the display will initalize

The switch has two states:

When off, the program will print closed, and will display the last time recorded

When on, the photoresistors will be active
  The program will check the photoresistors every 250ms, and if at least two are off, then it will enter the stopped phase
  The program will remain in the stopped phase until the switch is turned off
  You can turn on the switch again for the next test
  
Things to note:
The timer records time in milliseconds, so 14500 is equal to 14.5 seconds
The program starts checking the instant the switch is flipped, so try to synchronize your reaction starting with the switch
If there are any issues, please ask in the slack
